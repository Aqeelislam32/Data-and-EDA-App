# EDA Tool - A Streamlit Web App

This project is a Streamlit web application designed to simplify Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The app provides an intuitive interface for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and profiling. 

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Quickly view and explore your dataset with interactive options to visualize column distributions, generate basic statistics, and understand your data better.
- **Data Cleaning**: Perform essential data cleaning tasks, including feature selection, filtering data, and handling missing values using various methods like mean, median, or dropping missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Automatically generate histograms and other plots for numerical columns, allowing for a quick visual inspection of the data.
- **Data Profiling**: Generate a comprehensive data profiling report using `ydata_profiling`, offering insights into variables, interactions, correlations, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Customizable interface with options to change background color, sidebar color, and button styles, ensuring a clean and professional look.

## Installation
